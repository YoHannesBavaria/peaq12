Designed with direct input from administrators and presales engineers, this release brings over 100 improvements for automation, security, integration, and usability—enhancing control without sacrificing speed.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"strengthened-security-and-governance\">Strengthened Security and Governance</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Four Eyes Principle:</strong> SAM4H 2.4 introduces a comprehensive approval workflow enforcing dual authorization for critical operations. Every request, approval, and rejection is logged with timestamps, identities, and full audit detail—supporting compliance with SOX, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, and similar frameworks.</p>\n\n<p><strong>SAML 2.0 Single Sign-On:</strong> Seamless integration with identity providers like Azure AD, Okta, and Ping Identity centralizes access control. Users sign in with corporate credentials, while IT teams gain automated provisioning, immediate revocation, and MFA enforcement.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Additional Enhancements:</strong> Role-based API access, account lockout policies, and privilege protections further harden SAM4H 2.4 against unauthorized access.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"smarter-safer-automation\">Smarter, Safer Automation</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Replace WWN:</strong> Fully automates HBA replacement workflows—discovering, validating, and updating WWNs across configurations in minutes while maintaining audit logs and approval options.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Zero-Downtime Volume Expansion:</strong> Both GAD and HUR replication volumes can now be expanded online without resynchronization—supporting database growth and capacity changes with no service impact.</p>\n\n<p><strong>DRD to DRS Migration:</strong> Migrate to modern replication technology without data moves or downtime. Pre-checks, rollback options, and compatibility validation simplify the process.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Advanced Port Management:</strong> Administrators can now modify port speed, topology, and attributes directly through SAM4H with validation and optional approval workflows.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"better-visibility-and-monitoring\">Better Visibility and Monitoring</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Snapshot Policy Dashboard:</strong> A new proactive view consolidates snapshot performance, success rates, alerts, and failure analytics. Trend data helps predict capacity needs and identify failing policies before backup windows are missed.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Replication &amp; Volume Reports:</strong> Enhanced filtering, performance metrics, replication flags, and CSV exports provide clear insights across large, multi-site environments.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"broader-integration-and-api-power\">Broader Integration and API Power</h2>\n\n<p><strong>HPE XP Array Support:</strong> SAM4H now manages Hitachi-based HPE XP arrays, giving administrators a unified management interface.</p>\n\n<p><strong>REST API Expansion:</strong> Dozens of new endpoints—covering storage, host, replication, and job management—support Infrastructure-as-Code workflows and seamless integration with CI/CD pipelines or orchestration platforms like Ansible, VMware, and Kubernetes.</p>\n\n<p><strong>IOportal Agent Integration:</strong> SAM4H now includes full IOportal Agent Integration. Collect performance data from all your Hitachi Block Storage arrays using Export Monitor v1 or v2, and automatically upload it to peaq’s Cloud Monitoring Solution, IOportal. Deliver a seamless, unified monitoring experience across your Hitachi storage environment.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"enhanced-user-experience\">Enhanced User Experience</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Volume Template Wizard:</strong> Set up basic volume templates through a user friendly wizzard, for quicker onboarding new installations.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Interface Improvements:</strong> Refined dark mode, responsive layouts, inline validation, and universal search make navigation faster and more accessible across devices.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Performance Gains:</strong> Database and frontend optimizations deliver faster load times, smoother tables, and quicker reporting, even in large environments.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Internationalization:</strong> Full UI translations now available in English, German, French, Spanish, and Portuguese, enabling global teams to work effortlessly in their preferred language.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"snapshot--replication-advances\">Snapshot &amp; Replication Advances</h2>\n\n<p>Policy enhancements include flexible pool assignment, consistency group snapshots, customizable scheduling down to 15-minute intervals, and import/export for policy reuse. Replication enhancements support non-resync GAD migrations, continuous HUR protection during expansion, and microprocessor-based volume balancing.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"infrastructure--reliability\">Infrastructure &amp; Reliability</h2>\n\n<p>Behind the scenes, SAM4H 2.4 introduces automatic background service health checks, better job scheduling via SolidQueue, TimescaleDB integration for faster time-based reporting, and improved installer reliability.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"upgrade-and-compatibility\">Upgrade and Compatibility</h2>\n\n<p>Upgrading from SAM4H 2.3 is straightforward with minimal downtime. All existing integrations remain compatible, and new features like HPE XP support extend SAM4H’s enterprise reach.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"why-sam4h-24-matters\">Why SAM4H 2.4 Matters</h2>\n\n<p>This release delivers measurable results:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Stronger governance with full auditability</li>\n  <li>Faster, error-free operations through automation</li>\n  <li>Broader storage and API integration</li>\n  <li>Improved visibility for proactive management</li>\n  <li>Lower operational costs through streamlined workflows</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For enterprises managing mission-critical storage, SAM4H 2.4 provides the balance of control, security, and speed needed for modern operations.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p><em>SAM4H 2.4 is available now.

      },
      "bodyHtml": "<p>Dear IOportal User,</p>\n\n<p>it sometimes happens that we add a new graph to the IOportal Performance section. And we just did it again. Unlike other graphs the new graph does not display a timeseries of yet another resource of the storage system or attached ports or servers. This time the new graph comprises several resources in one graph, and this is new. From the implementation aspect this requires a different approach than for single resources graphs, which you may not find very interesting at all. But from the user point of view this opens a whole new set of possibilities to group resources together in order to visualise their correlation and dependencies between storage system resources or storage system resources and front-end load/performance directly. With this release we add a first new graph, the BoxOverview graph, which combines frontend load (Port IOPS and TPUT), frontend performance (SVCT and WTIM) together with the most critical backend resources of the storage system, namely parity group load, multiprocessor load, cache write pending and crossbar or interconnect switch load (where applicable).</p>\n\n<p>As this represents a lot of information we added a y-legend on the right-hand side so we can show independent metrics, like IOPS and TPUT, with different physical units, in a single plot. Also, we show average as well as max values for the backend resources, as there may be many instances, like many MP blades, with relatively moderate average values, but high max values potentially causing performance degradations or resource constraints.</p>\n\n<p>So hopefully the new BoxOverview graphs provides you with a good overview of the storage systems’ overall dynamical behaviour and helps you spot potential issues quicker. Of course, any performance issues are still detected by the IOportal’s anomaly radar, which guides you to the root cause(s) of any spotted anomaly. So please take a look at the new BoxOverview graph and let us know whether you find it useful and/or you have other resources/metrics in mind you would like to see plotted together.</p>\n\n<p>Have a great day!\nYour IOportal team</p>"

      "bodyHtml": "<p>The new version of IOportal is the elephant in the room: it never forgets and remembers \ntimeseries that reach back years in the past… . These are the major and minor features \nof our Winter 2023 update:</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"limitless-timeseries-graphics\">Limitless Timeseries Graphics</h4>\n\n<p>Breaking with the tradition of monitoring tools that keep a limited amount of historical \ntimeseries data - usually spanning a short timerange - starting with this release the IOportal \ndoes not delete <strong>any</strong> historic data. Furthermore, it allows the users to create graphics \nwithin seconds that <strong>span multiple years</strong>! Currently, the earliest data available go back to May 2020. \nThis signature feature allows users of the IOportal to conduct (very) long-term analysis over any \nresource of interest and explore how its utilisation has evolved since the beginning of array was\ncommissioned in the IOportal. This unique possibility is especially helpful when investigating\nhardware upgrades, lifecycle considerations or slow-creeping performance issues.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"much-improved-detail-selector\">Much Improved “Detail” selector</h4>\n\n<p>The “Storage Resources –&gt; Details” selector in the Performance Menu allows the user to select one \nor more entities of a given resource, e.g. different frontend ports. We greatly improved the usability of \nthe selector in various ways:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>the selector does not freeze with every selected item, thus allowing the user to quickly select \nseveral entities without confusion</li>\n  <li>the new “select all” and “deselect all” buttons make it a breeze to filter the entities \nand select or deselect multiple entities at once</li>\n  <li>The servers are now displayed in categories as Active or Inactive. This greatly assists users \nwhen selecting a server, since they also obtain the crucial information whether the servers at\nhand are still active or not</li>\n  <li>The individual Ldevs shown for the Resource “Ldev Performance” now include the customer-define \nLdev nickname. This makes it possible to filter for specific nicknames and then select all results at once \nby means of the new “Select All” button</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4 id=\"various-improvements\">Various Improvements</h4>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>“Dashboard KPI Trends” page: the dashboard KPI trends page received a significant performance \nboost for customers with many arrays</li>\n  <li>Improved Navigation: it is now possible to access the performance graphics of a server or Ldev \ndirectly through the “Capacity -&gt; Server Cluster Report” page. New icons are available next to \nthe server cluster name or the Ldev name(s), that directly navigate to the Performance \nMenu and trigger the creation of the respective graphic(s)</li>\n  <li>Improvements to interactive performance graphics: all timeseries graphics which display a single \nplot (e.g. MP, CWPR, etc.) now exhibit a description of the y-axis, identical to the description \nfound in the png version of the graphic</li>\n  <li>Ldev Nicknames: Ldev performance graphics now include the Ldev nickname in the title</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4 id=\"adr-views-in-capacity-beta\">ADR Views in Capacity (beta)</h4>\n\n<p>Support for ADR in the IOportal has started. The first features - with more to come - are:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Automatic Pool categorisation: The IOportal automatically detects the capacity savings type \nof pools. Possible categories are: FMC pool, ADR (Compression), ADR (Compression \n&amp; Deduplication) or no capacity savings. The capacity savings type of a pool is always shown \nnext to the pool name on all affected pages/views. Note: in order to activate this feature the \nIOportal requires additional output from the Raidcom command. This may require an update of \nthe collector scripts - please contact support@peaq.ch for assistance.</li>\n  <li>The “Capacity -&gt; Storage Array Report” page has a new visualisation for ADR-enabled pools. \nThe capacity savings value is displayed, along with a computed logical view that corresponds\nto the capacity as seen by the consumers. Note: the ADR features are still work in progress \nand will improve over time</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4 id=\"docker-version-for-on-premise-installations\">Docker Version for On-Premise Installations</h4>\n\n<p>Starting with this release our on-premise customers can enjoy the benefits of a containerised \nsolution: effortless installation and updates, even in fully isolated environments without internet access.</p>"

      "bodyHtml": "<p>Today we are proud to announce version 2.1 of the Smart Automation Manager For Hitachi, SAM4H. \nAfter introducing a new design in version 2.0, we further improved performance and polished the UI. \nNevertheless, this release brings very useful new features like LUN editing, an extended full-text \nsearch and an enhanced dashboard. On top of that, the majority of the configuration options are \nnow stored in the database, which enables changing parameters without the need to restart the application.</p>\n\n<p>The first published version of SAM4H in 2016 was already strictly designed along concrete customer \nrequirements. This paradigm has remained peaq’s approach to define and implement new features \nand functionalities. Now let us have a look at what SAM4H V2.1 has to offer.</p>\n\n<p>The first thing you notice when you start SAM4H V2.1 is the new dashboard: in the first row you \nsee all important capacity KPIs at a glance. The second diagram offers an interactive capacity overview \nbar chart over all arrays, while the following diagram shows the same capacity comparison in form of \na treemap chart. Clicking on an array either on the bar chart or treemap chart leads you to the \nnew array dashboard, which offers a drill-down into the capacity of the clusters of the selected storage \narray. The final chart on the dashboard page depicts a statistic of all tasks executed in SAM4H, \ngrouped by type, state or user for a user-defined time-range.</p>\n\n<p>Besides the mentioned features, SAM4H v2.1 offers following improvements:</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sam4h-v21-release-notes\">SAM4H v2.1 Release Notes</h3>\n\n<h4 id=\"general-improvements\">General improvements</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Extended full-text search:</strong>\nA global full-text search allows for searching and finding objects across the entire SAM4H landscape</li>\n  <li><strong><em>Config options in the database:</em></strong>\nThe content of the famous config.yml-file is now stored almost entirely in the database, allowing \nconfig-changes without the need to restart the application. The whole file is loaded automatically \nduring the first start after the migration.</li>\n  <li><strong><em>Multiple performance improvements for large installations:</em></strong>\nVarious performance improvements in the array management and the reports make SAM4H ready for \ninstallations with several dozens of storage arrays.</li>\n  <li><strong><em>Real dark mode:</em></strong>\nSAM4H v2.1 offers a completely redesigned dark mode.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4 id=\"array-management\">Array Management</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong><em>Edit LUNs:</em></strong>\nEdit LUNs is finally here. This empowers SAM4H to change LUN-parameters of existing volumes.</li>\n  <li><strong><em>MP-Pinning:</em></strong>\nVolumes configured on the wrong MP can lead to cross-I/O which degrades the I/O-performance between \nthe server and the array. On VSP5000 series, SAM4H automatically determines the optimal MPU based on\nthe mapped ports and pins volumes to this MPU, thus optimising performance.</li>\n  <li><strong><em>Notes:</em></strong>\nEvery DpvConfigTemplate can now be extended with specific notes and information for the storage \noperators. Notes can also be added to the login screen, e.g. a disclaimer.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4 id=\"reports\">Reports</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong><em>New dashboard:</em></strong>\nMore insights, thanks to the new and completely revamped dashboard.</li>\n  <li><strong><em>ALUA warnings in the Cluster LUN Report:</em></strong>\nThe Cluster LUN Report was extended with warnings about misconfigured sites and host-groups, \nwhich could potentially lead to false ALUA-configuration.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4 id=\"gui\">GUI</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong><em>All forms displayed in modals:</em></strong>\nForms are displayed in modals. This preserves search results and makes the UI more streamlined.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4 id=\"rest-api\">REST-API</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong><em>REST-API for hosts:</em></strong>\nThe REST-API was extended by a host-API. Now it is possible, to configure / read hosts through REST-calls.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Already being established as the state-of-the-art storage management tool for Hitachi storage, \nSAM4H V2.1 brings along a whole set of exciting and useful new features that help facilitate storage \nadministrators’ life even more.</p>"

      "bodyHtml": "<p>Our latest IOportal release brings several improvements above and under the hood, as well \nas a multitude of useful new features:</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"new-ports-and-ldev-groups-graphics\">New “Ports and Ldev Groups” graphics</h4>\n\n<p>Identifying which frontend ports are mapped to which servers and preparing the respective graphics \ncan be a cumbersome and time-consuming task. The new feature in the Performance menu, available as \n“Ports and Ldev Groups” under the <em>Storage Resources</em> menu, provides an easy and intuitive solution to \nthis problem. The user is presented with those port tuples that are currently mapped by server clusters. \nBy choosing one such tuple, the user obtains performance graphics of all involved ports as well as \nof all server clusters that have mapped the selected port tuple, along with a top10 server graphic. \nThis time-saving feature makes root-cause analysis even faster and easier!</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"new-automatic-time-resolution-in-performance-graphics\">New automatic time resolution in performance graphics</h4>\n\n<p>So far, users could choose the desired time resolution for performance graphics, amongst \n1 min, 5 min and 1 hour. For practical reasons, the IOportal retains data with low resolution for \nshorter periods of time. Data is retained indefinitely for 1 hour resolution. Hence, it could \nhappen that the user chose a time resolution in combination with a time range where data is not \navailable. Furthermore, when creating time series graphics over long periods of time, e.g. several \nweeks or months, it is important to switch to the largest available resolution.\nIn our latest release, all this is handled automatically in the best possible manner. The user can leave \nthe resolution switch to “auto” and he will always get time series graphics in the best available \nresolution, without minding the details.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"compare-any-two-graphics-side-by-side\">Compare any two graphics side-by-side</h4>\n\n<p>During a root-cause-analysis it is common to look for time correlation amongst different resources \nand metrics. Looking for specific time ranges across different graphics is tedious and error-prone. \nHowever, the user can now choose any two graphics and view them next to each other. Furthermore, \nthe crosshair lines when hovering over a plot are synchronised across both graphics, making it \neasier than ever to compare different plots.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"new-server-clusters-tree-map-view\">New Server Clusters Tree Map View</h4>\n\n<p>The Server Clusters report now includes a new tree map graphic that provides an overview \nof all server clusters of the array, scaled according to their relative allocated or used \ncapacity. A tabular representation, that can be downloaded in spread sheet format,\ncomplements the tree map and makes it easy to see all server cluster at a glance. \nFurthermore, the tree map acts as a navigation element and makes it easy to select a \nserver cluster and see its details below the tree map graphic.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"new-port-load-imbalance-alerts\">New Port Load Imbalance Alerts</h4>\n\n<p>The throughput of ports pairs (e.g. CL1-A and CL2-A) is expected to be more or less identical \nunder nominal conditions, where multipathing software splits the traffic equally between ports. \nImbalanced ports are a common reason for performance issues or inefficiencies and require investigation. \nThe new “Port Load Imbalance Alert” automatically monitors the throughput of all port pairs during \nthe previous day and alerts the user when significant load imbalances are detected.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"new-pool-thresholds-alerts\">New Pool Thresholds Alerts</h4>\n\n<p>Pool alerts have been part of the IOportal for several years. The threshold values were fixed \nand corresponded to Hitachi best practices, i.e. warning above 70% and risk above 85%. However, \nsince each pool is utilised differently by our customers, we now use the custom threshold values \nthat are defined on a per-pool basis by the customer himself in their management software. These custom \nthresholds are made available to the IOportal along with the capacity data (HORCM) \nand are henceforth used for driving the pool alerts, i.e. customers are only alerted when a pool\ncrosses the threshold that they themselves have defined. We are confident that the new solution will \nprove more useful and less intrusive.</p>"

The latest high-end systems from Hitachi\ncome in different configurations, VSP 5100/5200, VSP 5500/5600 2N, 4N and 6N, \nand facilitate IO traffic between nodes via the novel Hitachi Accelerated \nFabric. The departure from the crossbar architecture of older high-end systems\ncomes with new chances as well as challenges.</p>\n\n<p>Operating and optimising VSP 5000 systems requires understanding how<br />\nthe load is distributed amongst different CBX Pairs and controllers, as well\nas how the resources of different CBX Pairs and controllers are utilised. \nThe new architecture suggests that different path configurations experience\ndifferent latencies and, hence, understanding the potential front-end cross and \nfront-end straight scenarios becomes important to those customers that \nstrive for the best performance in the most challenging environments.</p>\n\n<p>The new peaq analysis tools take up the challenge and decompose all relevant KPIs \nin the respective CBX Pairs (or controller failover pairs), thus offering a \ntransparent view of the VSP 5000 internals. The multitude\nof graphs that are specifically developed for the Health Check service\nare adapted to account for this new decomposition and offer a deeper \nunderstanding of the system operation. Automated tools analyse the\nconfiguration paths of all volumes and all servers, thus identifying the exact \nextent of front-end cross I/Os, as well as those cases where optimisation is \npossible, recommended or even required. With these new tools in our health check\narsenal, the customer gets a deeper understanding of his operations, while peaq\ncan offer fine-grained improvement suggestions for optimising performance, \nreducing operational risk and increasing IT efficiency.</p>\n\n<p>The new capabilities of the Health Check Service, akin to an\nfMRI image of VSP 5000 systems, enable our customers to truly\nget the most out of their Hitachi Enterprise Storage investment, even more so\nwith VSP 5000 systems!</p>\n\n<p>Your peaq team</p>"

      "bodyHtml": "<h3 id=\"state-of-the-art-storage-management\">State of the Art Storage Management</h3>\n<p>SAM4H is the most advanced Storage Management Tool available for Hitachi Block Storage today. Its outstanding ease of use, fast execution speed and optimal service quality make it the first customer choice and complements Hitachi’s outstanding Storage Hardware Solutions. In numerous situations SAM4H has turned around customers decisions in favour of Hitachi Storage when the onboard Management Tools were clearly rejected due to their well-known deficiencies. T-Systems, Mercedes, Infineon and Allianz are the amongst the most prestigious customers giving proof of that statement.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"its-all-about-automation-and-quality\">It’s all about automation and quality</h3>\n<p>Technically SAM4H (Smart Automation Manager for Hitachi) is a rules-based Management Tool that allows customers to manage Storage Volumes as well as replications in a fast and secure manner. Due to its rules-based nature it allows to completely separate Engineering and Operational Storage Management Tasks. Using SAM4H customers achieve a high level of automation. It’s just there, out of the box, without the need for any additional automation tool. Of course, SAM4H may also be driven by a high level task execution tool like a Change Management Tool or any other Automation Tool, even Ansible, with the help of its REST API interface.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"manage-gad-and-3dc-with-ease\">Manage GAD and 3DC with ease</h3>\n<p>SAM4H also supports the more and most complex Hitachi replication features in a robust, elegant and fool proof way like no other tool. Hiding the inherent complexity of replications any user can manage GAD (Global Active Device) and HUR (3DC) replications as easy as ordering a pizza from a web shop, requiring no specific knowledge of Hitachi Storage or Replications. Also unique to SAM4H - and an unquestionable MUST HAVE - is the wizard guided resynchronisation of replications after a disaster event, which allows in the most critical situations to re-establish replications, including the replication direction for each individual Volume.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"three-data-center-3dc\">Three Data Center (3DC)</h3>\n<p>3DC or ‘Three Data Center’ is the most complex Hitachi Storage System setup between 3 data centres and 3 Storage Systems featuring a synchronous copy between 2 data centres (called Primary and Secondary) using GAD and 2 asynchronous copies between Primary and Secondary, respectively, and a third data center. Its goal is to allow for an extra 3rd data copy beyond the 2 copies already provided via GAD and thus to enhance data availability even further. While synchronous copies (via GAD) are limited in terms of distance, 3DC, due to its asynchronous nature overcomes this limitation allowing for any distance between Primary, Secondary and the 3rd data center.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"managing-gad-and-3dc-objects\">Managing GAD and 3DC objects</h3>\n<p>Managing 3DC objects (Volumes and Replications) involves managing GAD objects, as they are part of a 3DC relationship, plus managing 2 asynchronous copy relationships between Primary, Secondary and the 3rd data center. On a per Volume level (Volumes being storage objects presented to servers and perceived by the latters as Disks where ultimately the customer data is stored). Typical Volume and Replication operations include Creating, Growing, Shrinking and deleting Volumes as well as Creating, Syncing and Splitting Replications (in this case GAD and 3DC replications). Considering a customer environment wit dozens of Storage Systems and tens of Thousands of Volumes we quickly get an idea of the inherent complexity of this solution, clearly underlining the necessity for a very sophisticated management tool, allowing to manage Volumes and replications in a secure, fast, robust and reliable way.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"managing-gad-and-3dc-with-sam4h\">Managing GAD and 3DC with SAM4H</h3>\n<p>Unlike other solutions SAM4H allows to manage GAD and 3DC objects without requiring to understand Hitachi Storage and the internals of GAD and 3DC. In fact some of the SAM4H customers have aprentices with little to no experience in the storage arena doing all the daily business Volume and Replication Management including GAD and 3DC completely autonomously using SAM4H. This is mainly owed to SAM4H’s rules based architecture allowing to completely separate Engineering and Operational tasks.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sam4h-3dc-customer-case\">SAM4H 3DC Customer Case</h3>\n<p>In a large Hitachi Customer Environment 32 Storage Systems spread across 3 data centres with some 800 km distance between Primary, Secondary and the 3rd location. Consisting of several tens of Thousands of Volumes, managing this huge 3DC environment based on the on-board tools required more and more effort rendering the environment more and more unmanageable.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"storage-migrations-made-easy\">Storage migrations made easy</h3>\n<p>Storage Migrations can be executed using SAM4H in an automated and non-disruptive manner. It allows the user to assign all the Volumes required on the new System in an easy graphical way and also copies the data using GAD. Complementing SAM4H with dedicated migration reports by IOportal, the state of the art Capacity and Performance Management Tool by peaq, the load across the ports on the new Storage System can be perfectly balanced ensuring equally perfectly balanced Storage System Backend utilisation.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"why-peaq-tools\">Why peaq tools?</h3>\n<p>peaq has been providing tools to improve efficiency and manageability of Hitachi block storage systems for almost 10 years now, with some common, compelling features, that make them customer’s first choice.

Furthermore, customers’ export files will still be received and processed by the IOportal.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"a-solution-is-born\">A solution is born</h3>\n\n<p>When we set out to develop a disaster recovery solution, it quickly became clear that we first need to clearly define the business cases that should be protected. This exercise resulted in a detailed functionality scope that the solution must fulfil. This first specification helped to coarsely decide on the sizing and capabilities of the disaster recovery solution. Next, we set out to discuss non-functional requirements, especially around operating the system. Such a requirement was for instance the need to keep the code version on both production and disaster recovery systems in sync without manual intervention. Another area of intensive discussion was the need to limit day-to-day operational activities to the production system alone, instead of duplicating the workload and maintain two systems. As the discussions proceeded, a list of tasks formed with all various custom implementations that are required in order to achieve our goals. Finally, a crucial part of the design process was the careful E2E simulation of the various steps and phases that will play out during a disaster event:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Detecting the disaster</li>\n  <li>Deciding whether to switch to the disaster recovery solution or not</li>\n  <li>Operations during disaster recovery</li>\n  <li>Recovery of primary system</li>\n  <li>Resuming regular operations</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Going through all theses steps again and again while considering all system aspects, i.e. networking, DNS etc., validated our design and further revealed all the bits and pieces that were missing in terms of functionality.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"disaster-recovery-architecture\">Disaster Recovery Architecture</h3>\n\n<p>At the end we devised following architecture:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Offsite location for disaster recovery, in the same VPN as our data center</li>\n  <li>Fully automatic setup of disaster recovery site via Ansible (infrastructure): this includes installing the OS, bootstrapping and installing dedicated software packages on three VMs per environment (total 6 VMs)</li>\n  <li>Automatic application deployment (both front and backend) via Capistrano simultaneously on both sites (see our dedicated blog post on Capistrano</li>\n  <li>Batch jobs for periodically copying over the production database and required csv files from production to disaster recovery, such that we achieve our desired Recovery Point Objective (RPO)</li>\n  <li>Activation of disaster recovery solution via change of either nameservers or A-records. Users are automatically routed to the secondary site</li>\n  <li>Automatic instantaneous duplication of export files between production and disaster recovery sites (both directions)</li>\n  <li>Automatic heartbeat monitoring of production system from offsite location and alerting</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"is-it-worth-it\">Is it worth it?</h2>\n\n<p>Implementing the disaster recovery solution required significant effort. However, a great deal of it involved implementing automatisation which benefits the system per se, irrespective of the disaster recovery case. With every new environment that we set up and every new rollout we perform, we save time and get standardised and improved quality. This is for sure a worthy investment that keeps paying dividends with time.

This information may be parsed and fed into the dashboard of your company’s monitoring tool of choice. Therefore, the REST API connects the IOportal with your company’s dashboard that can now display up-to-date information about your storage systems.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"security-first\">Security first</h3>\n\n<p>In order to leverage the IOportal REST API you need a valid IOportal user account. Furthermore, access to the data is secured via SSL using the same mechanism that ensures the security of your data upload to the IOportal. This simply means that nobody else but you has access to the data, offering the same level of security you are used to when doing financial transactions via the Internet.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"detailed-documentation\">Detailed documentation</h3>\n\n<p>Once logged into the IOportal, you will find the REST API documentation under the “Account” menu in the navigation bar. The documentation describes in detail the tools necessary and the steps required to access information about your company’s storage systems. Comprehensive examples help you quickly get up to speed and soon extract your first data using the IOportal REST API.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"from-data-to-insight\">From data to insight</h3>\n\n<p>Data is offered in a standard format (JSON) for which many tools exist for further processing. You may extract detailed information of all capacity aspects of each storage pool, including pool size, used capacity and compression ratio. Use this information to raise an alarm in your standard issue management tool in case critical thresholds are exceeded. In order to be able to react to changes in the dynamical behaviour of your storage systems, use the data extracted from the dashboard tables offering the same values you are already familiar with from the IOportal dashboard view: Your storage system’s 24 hour average workload, its respective average response time indicating bottlenecks at an early stage, daily threshold excess pointing out resource constraints and servers affected by performance degradation.\nGet the most out of your Hitachi Storage Systems</p>\n\n<p>The IOportal REST API lets you tightly integrate information about your storage systems into your operations data center environment helping you get the most out of your Hitachi storage systems.</p>"

The new alerting functionality informs the IOportal user of all significant events as soon as the user logs in, by displaying appropriately colored banners – one for each alert category. Clicking on the banner forwards the user to the respective detailed view. Furthermore, a new navigation menu, denoted by an exclamation mark, acts as the alert home page and provides further details on each alert. Finally, the user can subscribe to a daily email that summarises all alerts.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"alert-categories\">Alert Categories</h3>\n\n<p>Following alert categories are available in the first incarnation of the feature:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Pool Capacity Alerts</strong>: a warning alert is triggered when the physical or logical pool capacity is above 75%. A risk alert is triggered when the pool utilisation is above 85%.</li>\n  <li><strong>HORCM File Delivery Alerts</strong>: warning or error alerts are triggered when certain HORCM files have not been delivered or updated during the last 24 hours or 3 days, respectively.</li>\n  <li><strong>Export File Delivery Alerts</strong>: warning or error alerts are triggered when the last 24 hours, respectively 72 hours, are not covered by export log files.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"outlook\">Outlook</h3>\n\n<p>The above alert categories lay the foundation for monitoring a storage array: they comprise pool capacity alerts, which may cause a standstill of operations if they a pool runs full, and file delivery alerts (export and horcm), since we can’t monitor anything if the monitoring log files are not available. Future releases will further build on this powerful feature and provide finer grained and more sophisticated alerts which will increase the value proposition of the IOportal even further!

The new version has some long awaited features like tenant capability and deletion of host groups. Thanks to the integration of Elasticsearch it is now possible to efficiently search across all executed tasks.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"tenant-capability\">Tenant capability</h4>\n\n<p>This has been one of the most awaited features: It is now possible to create users which only have privileges for non destructive tasks on selected servers. This will let you create a self-service portal for adding and removing LUNs to some servers. Unix and DB administrators are now allowed to manage their own server storage by themselves.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"gad-monitoring\">GAD Monitoring</h4>\n\n<p>With the new GAD Monitoring feature, SAM4H periodically checks if GAD replications exist, which are not in pair. If any broken pairs are found, an email notification is generated.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"full-text-search\">Full text search</h4>\n\n<p>Over time, the timeline in the main view can get very long.

Each tile (see figure) represents a pool and displays the pool status as well as the most relevant physical capacity measures. If the pool status is already at risk level, i.e. used capacity is above 85%, the whole pool tile is drawn on a red background. This way it is easy to immediately spot pools (or storage arrays) that require attention.</p>\n\n<p>Once a user is interested in the details of a particular pool, he is presented with a new view organizes the various pool figures into virtual, logical and physical ones.

Each bubble represents one DP-pool whereas the color of the bubble indicates the storage array. The horizontal position of a bubble represents the allocated pool size. The vertical position represents the  percentage of used capacity. Bubbles that are close to the 100% line are almost full. Is this a problem?</p>\n\n<p>Well, it depends. If the pool size is still growing, then maybe. If the pool size is growing fast, then certainly. We capture these dynamics in the size of the bubbles: big bubbles indicate pools that are growing „fast“. How fast is fast?</p>\n\n<p>Actually it does not matter. What matters is how soon we expect the pool to run full. Hence, very big bubbles indicate pools that will run full within 3 months. You want to do something about those. The smaller the bubble size, the longer it takes until the pool runs full.</p>\n\n<p>So in fact it does not matter if a pool is close to 100% full. There may be a new pool lurking with lots of free space, that nevertheless grows rapidly and requires close monitoring. The bubble size is all you need to look at.</p>\n\n<p>So there you are.

Although such applications are not publicly accessible, you want to secure their connections by SSL though.</p>\n\n<p>The typical recommendation for deploying Rails-Apps says, you should set up NGINX or Apache to serve the assets and use those web servers as reverse proxies for routing all dynamic requests to the Rails application-server (like Unicorn or Puma). But  typically such private applications do not have heavy load and it would be overkill to deploy them with this approach. It would be handy to have an application server, which handles SSL directly. The good answer: It is possible with Puma!</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"configure-your-rails-app-to-use-puma\">Configure your Rails-App to use Puma</h3>\n\n<p>First you need to configure Puma to be your application  server. There’s a good chance, that you can skip this step as Puma is the default application server since Rails 5. But for all which are still using Rails 4, add the following line to your Gemfile:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-bash highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>gem <span class=\"s1\">'puma'</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<h3 id=\"create-your-ssl-certificates\">Create your SSL certificates</h3>\n\n<p>Once Puma is your default application server, it is time to create the SSL certificates. We are using openssl for this.
