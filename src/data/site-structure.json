Its outstanding ease of use, fast execution speed and optimal service quality make it the first customer choice and complements Hitachi’s outstanding Storage Hardware Solutions. In numerous situations SAM4H has turned around customers decisions in favour of Hitachi Storage when the onboard Management Tools were clearly rejected due to their well-known deficiencies. T-Systems, Mercedes, Infineon and Allianz are the amongst the most prestigious customers giving proof of that statement. It’s all about automation and quality Technically SAM4H (Smart Automation Manager for Hitachi) is a rules-based Management Tool that allows customers to manage Storage Volumes as well as replications in a fast and secure manner. Due to its rules-based nature it allows to completely separate Engineering and Operational Storage Management Tasks. Using SAM4H customers achieve a high level of automation. It’s just there, out of the box, without the need for any additional automation tool. Of course, SAM4H may also be driven by a high level task execution tool like a Change Management Tool or any other Automation Tool, even Ansible, with the help of its REST API interface. Manage GAD and 3DC with ease SAM4H also supports the more and most complex Hitachi replication features in a robust, elegant and fool proof way like no other tool. Hiding the inherent complexity of replications any user can manage GAD (Global Active Device) and HUR (3DC) replications as easy as ordering a pizza from a web shop, requiring no specific knowledge of Hitachi Storage or Replications. Also unique to SAM4H - and an unquestionable MUST HAVE - is the wizard guided resynchronisation of replications after a disaster event, which allows in the most critical situations to re-establish replications, including the replication direction for each individual Volume. Three Data Center (3DC) 3DC or ‘Three Data Center’ is the most complex Hitachi Storage System setup between 3 data centres and 3 Storage Systems featuring a synchronous copy between 2 data centres (called Primary and Secondary) using GAD and 2 asynchronous copies between Primary and Secondary, respectively, and a third data center. Its goal is to allow for an extra 3rd data copy beyond the 2 copies already provided via GAD and thus to enhance data availability even further. While synchronous copies (via GAD) are limited in terms of distance, 3DC, due to its asynchronous nature overcomes this limitation allowing for any distance between Primary, Secondary and the 3rd data center. Managing GAD and 3DC objects Managing 3DC objects (Volumes and Replications) involves managing GAD objects, as they are part of a 3DC relationship, plus managing 2 asynchronous copy relationships between Primary, Secondary and the 3rd data center. On a per Volume level (Volumes being storage objects presented to servers and perceived by the latters as Disks where ultimately the customer data is stored). Typical Volume and Replication operations include Creating, Growing, Shrinking and deleting Volumes as well as Creating, Syncing and Splitting Replications (in this case GAD and 3DC replications). Considering a customer environment wit dozens of Storage Systems and tens of Thousands of Volumes we quickly get an idea of the inherent complexity of this solution, clearly underlining the necessity for a very sophisticated management tool, allowing to manage Volumes and replications in a secure, fast, robust and reliable way. Managing GAD and 3DC with SAM4H Unlike other solutions SAM4H allows to manage GAD and 3DC objects without requiring to understand Hitachi Storage and the internals of GAD and 3DC. In fact some of the SAM4H customers have aprentices with little to no experience in the storage arena doing all the daily business Volume and Replication Management including GAD and 3DC completely autonomously using SAM4H. This is mainly owed to SAM4H’s rules based architecture allowing to completely separate Engineering and Operational tasks. SAM4H 3DC Customer Case In a large Hitachi Customer Environment 32 Storage Systems spread across 3 data centres with some 800 km distance between Primary, Secondary and the 3rd location. Consisting of several tens of Thousands of Volumes, managing this huge 3DC environment based on the on-board tools required more and more effort rendering the environment more and more unmanageable. Storage migrations made easy Storage Migrations can be executed using SAM4H in an automated and non-disruptive manner. It allows the user to assign all the Volumes required on the new System in an easy graphical way and also copies the data using GAD. Complementing SAM4H with dedicated migration reports by IOportal, the state of the art Capacity and Performance Management Tool by peaq, the load across the ports on the new Storage System can be perfectly balanced ensuring equally perfectly balanced Storage System Backend utilisation.

Based on the IOportal Cloud Service, it offers customers wide-ranging support to facilitate the daily work but also to facilitate recurring tasks that impose additional workload. The periodic Health Checks , part of the Proactive Service, are based on a set of graphs specifically designed for this purpose, focussing on long term trends and slow creeping performance degradations. The graphs together with expert’s comments are compiled in the health check report, which is presented and discussed preferably face-to-face on customer premises, or otherwise remotely. The goal of the service is to identify and mitigate resource constraints/bottlenecks/saturation before they impact application performance and/or increase operational risk. The customer benefits from improved and stabilised I/O performance during the life-cycle of his systems, reduced operational risk and increased IT efficiency through optimised used of the available resources. Our latest upgrade to the Health Checks service focuses on the novel architecture of VSP 5000 systems . The latest high-end systems from Hitachi come in different configurations, VSP 5100/5200, VSP 5500/5600 2N, 4N and 6N, and facilitate IO traffic between nodes via the novel Hitachi Accelerated Fabric. The departure from the crossbar architecture of older high-end systems comes with new chances as well as challenges. Operating and optimising VSP 5000 systems requires understanding how the load is distributed amongst different CBX Pairs and controllers, as well as how the resources of different CBX Pairs and controllers are utilised. The new architecture suggests that different path configurations experience different latencies and, hence, understanding the potential front-end cross and front-end straight scenarios becomes important to those customers that strive for the best performance in the most challenging environments. The new peaq analysis tools take up the challenge and decompose all relevant KPIs in the respective CBX Pairs (or controller failover pairs), thus offering a transparent view of the VSP 5000 internals. The multitude of graphs that are specifically developed for the Health Check service are adapted to account for this new decomposition and offer a deeper understanding of the system operation. Automated tools analyse the configuration paths of all volumes and all servers, thus identifying the exact extent of front-end cross I/Os, as well as those cases where optimisation is possible, recommended or even required. With these new tools in our health check arsenal, the customer gets a deeper understanding of his operations, while peaq can offer fine-grained improvement suggestions for optimising performance, reducing operational risk and increasing IT efficiency. The new capabilities of the Health Check Service, akin to an fMRI image of VSP 5000 systems, enable our customers to truly get the most out of their Hitachi Enterprise Storage investment, even more so with VSP 5000 systems!

The capacity information is available on pool level, server level as well as aggregated over all pools or even over all storage arrays of a customer. Now, our major redesign of the IOportal Capacity view takes the functionality to the next level, allowing the user to immediately identify the pools at risk. Pool Risk Status When it comes to operating an enterprise storage array nothing is more important than keeping track of the available free capacity on a pool level. The new Capacity View places the pool overview and the respective pool status front and center. Each tile (see figure) represents a pool and displays the pool status as well as the most relevant physical capacity measures. If the pool status is already at risk level, i.e. used capacity is above 85%, the whole pool tile is drawn on a red background. This way it is easy to immediately spot pools (or storage arrays) that require attention. Once a user is interested in the details of a particular pool, he is presented with a new view organizes the various pool figures into virtual, logical and physical ones. The logical and physical view take the newest FMC compression functionality into account. This allows the user to obtain a thorough understanding of the compression status of his pools. Did we draw your attention? You can find out more about the new Capacity view in the IOportal user guide. Not an IOportal customer yet? Do not hesitate to contact us to find out more.

This insight is also accessible for novice users because the IOportal overcomes the limitations of traditional tools, that require deep understanding of the Hitachi storage systems and extensive training on the monitoring tool itself. Today, we are glad to announce that the IOportal now offers integration with higher level monitoring systems via a state-of-the-art REST API, that lets you query and retrieve the crucial information you may want to integrate with your enterprise monitoring dashboard, like Splunk or Grafana. Get crucial, up-to-date storage system data without hassle The IOportal REST API offers the possibility to retrieve crucial dynamical information about your storage systems via commands executed in the background fully automatically and in regular intervals. This information may be parsed and fed into the dashboard of your company’s monitoring tool of choice. Therefore, the REST API connects the IOportal with your company’s dashboard that can now display up-to-date information about your storage systems. Security first In order to leverage the IOportal REST API you need a valid IOportal user account. Furthermore, access to the data is secured via SSL using the same mechanism that ensures the security of your data upload to the IOportal. This simply means that nobody else but you has access to the data, offering the same level of security you are used to when doing financial transactions via the Internet. Detailed documentation Once logged into the IOportal, you will find the REST API documentation under the “Account” menu in the navigation bar. The documentation describes in detail the tools necessary and the steps required to access information about your company’s storage systems. Comprehensive examples help you quickly get up to speed and soon extract your first data using the IOportal REST API. From data to insight Data is offered in a standard format (JSON) for which many tools exist for further processing. You may extract detailed information of all capacity aspects of each storage pool, including pool size, used capacity and compression ratio. Use this information to raise an alarm in your standard issue management tool in case critical thresholds are exceeded. In order to be able to react to changes in the dynamical behaviour of your storage systems, use the data extracted from the dashboard tables offering the same values you are already familiar with from the IOportal dashboard view: Your storage system’s 24 hour average workload, its respective average response time indicating bottlenecks at an early stage, daily threshold excess pointing out resource constraints and servers affected by performance degradation. Get the most out of your Hitachi Storage Systems The IOportal REST API lets you tightly integrate information about your storage systems into your operations data center environment helping you get the most out of your Hitachi storage systems.

And we just did it again. Unlike other graphs the new graph does not display a timeseries of yet another resource of the storage system or attached ports or servers. This time the new graph comprises several resources in one graph, and this is new. From the implementation aspect this requires a different approach than for single resources graphs, which you may not find very interesting at all. But from the user point of view this opens a whole new set of possibilities to group resources together in order to visualise their correlation and dependencies between storage system resources or storage system resources and front-end load/performance directly. With this release we add a first new graph, the BoxOverview graph, which combines frontend load (Port IOPS and TPUT), frontend performance (SVCT and WTIM) together with the most critical backend resources of the storage system, namely parity group load, multiprocessor load, cache write pending and crossbar or interconnect switch load (where applicable). As this represents a lot of information we added a y-legend on the right-hand side so we can show independent metrics, like IOPS and TPUT, with different physical units, in a single plot. Also, we show average as well as max values for the backend resources, as there may be many instances, like many MP blades, with relatively moderate average values, but high max values potentially causing performance degradations or resource constraints. So hopefully the new BoxOverview graphs provides you with a good overview of the storage systems’ overall dynamical behaviour and helps you spot potential issues quicker. Of course, any performance issues are still detected by the IOportal’s anomaly radar, which guides you to the root cause(s) of any spotted anomaly. So please take a look at the new BoxOverview graph and let us know whether you find it useful and/or you have other resources/metrics in mind you would like to see plotted together. Have a great day!

      "text": "IOportal Summer Update SAM4H IOportal Contact Support Blog peaq GmbH Analytics & automation Contact Info Neugutstrasse 12 Wallisellen 8304 Switzerland Learn More IOportal SAM4H Follow Us IOportal IOportal Summer Update 21 Jun 2022 By Georgios Psaltopoulos Our latest IOportal release brings several improvements above and under the hood, as well as a multitude of useful new features: New “Ports and Ldev Groups” graphics Identifying which frontend ports are mapped to which servers and preparing the respective graphics can be a cumbersome and time-consuming task. The new feature in the Performance menu, available as “Ports and Ldev Groups” under the Storage Resources menu, provides an easy and intuitive solution to this problem. The user is presented with those port tuples that are currently mapped by server clusters. By choosing one such tuple, the user obtains performance graphics of all involved ports as well as of all server clusters that have mapped the selected port tuple, along with a top10 server graphic. This time-saving feature makes root-cause analysis even faster and easier! New automatic time resolution in performance graphics So far, users could choose the desired time resolution for performance graphics, amongst 1 min, 5 min and 1 hour. For practical reasons, the IOportal retains data with low resolution for shorter periods of time. Data is retained indefinitely for 1 hour resolution. Hence, it could happen that the user chose a time resolution in combination with a time range where data is not available. Furthermore, when creating time series graphics over long periods of time, e.g. several weeks or months, it is important to switch to the largest available resolution. In our latest release, all this is handled automatically in the best possible manner. The user can leave the resolution switch to “auto” and he will always get time series graphics in the best available resolution, without minding the details. Compare any two graphics side-by-side During a root-cause-analysis it is common to look for time correlation amongst different resources and metrics. Looking for specific time ranges across different graphics is tedious and error-prone. However, the user can now choose any two graphics and view them next to each other. Furthermore, the crosshair lines when hovering over a plot are synchronised across both graphics, making it easier than ever to compare different plots. New Server Clusters Tree Map View The Server Clusters report now includes a new tree map graphic that provides an overview of all server clusters of the array, scaled according to their relative allocated or used capacity. A tabular representation, that can be downloaded in spread sheet format, complements the tree map and makes it easy to see all server cluster at a glance. Furthermore, the tree map acts as a navigation element and makes it easy to select a server cluster and see its details below the tree map graphic. New Port Load Imbalance Alerts The throughput of ports pairs (e.g. CL1-A and CL2-A) is expected to be more or less identical under nominal conditions, where multipathing software splits the traffic equally between ports. Imbalanced ports are a common reason for performance issues or inefficiencies and require investigation. The new “Port Load Imbalance Alert” automatically monitors the throughput of all port pairs during the previous day and alerts the user when significant load imbalances are detected. New Pool Thresholds Alerts Pool alerts have been part of the IOportal for several years. The threshold values were fixed and corresponded to Hitachi best practices, i.e. warning above 70% and risk above 85%. However, since each pool is utilised differently by our customers, we now use the custom threshold values that are defined on a per-pool basis by the customer himself in their management software. These custom thresholds are made available to the IOportal along with the capacity data (HORCM) and are henceforth used for driving the pool alerts, i.e. customers are only alerted when a pool crosses the threshold that they themselves have defined. We are confident that the new solution will prove more useful and less intrusive.

SAM4H IOportal Contact Support Blog peaq GmbH Analytics & automation Contact Info Neugutstrasse 12 Wallisellen 8304 Switzerland Learn More IOportal SAM4H Follow Us IOportal IOportal Winter Update - the elephant in the room! 01 Feb 2023 By Georgios Psaltopoulos The new version of IOportal is the elephant in the room: it never forgets and remembers timeseries that reach back years in the past… . These are the major and minor features of our Winter 2023 update: Limitless Timeseries Graphics Breaking with the tradition of monitoring tools that keep a limited amount of historical timeseries data - usually spanning a short timerange - starting with this release the IOportal does not delete any historic data. Furthermore, it allows the users to create graphics within seconds that span multiple years ! Currently, the earliest data available go back to May 2020. This signature feature allows users of the IOportal to conduct (very) long-term analysis over any resource of interest and explore how its utilisation has evolved since the beginning of array was commissioned in the IOportal. This unique possibility is especially helpful when investigating hardware upgrades, lifecycle considerations or slow-creeping performance issues. Much Improved “Detail” selector The “Storage Resources –&gt; Details” selector in the Performance Menu allows the user to select one or more entities of a given resource, e.g. different frontend ports. We greatly improved the usability of the selector in various ways: the selector does not freeze with every selected item, thus allowing the user to quickly select several entities without confusion the new “select all” and “deselect all” buttons make it a breeze to filter the entities and select or deselect multiple entities at once The servers are now displayed in categories as Active or Inactive. This greatly assists users when selecting a server, since they also obtain the crucial information whether the servers at hand are still active or not The individual Ldevs shown for the Resource “Ldev Performance” now include the customer-define Ldev nickname. This makes it possible to filter for specific nicknames and then select all results at once by means of the new “Select All” button Various Improvements “Dashboard KPI Trends” page: the dashboard KPI trends page received a significant performance boost for customers with many arrays Improved Navigation: it is now possible to access the performance graphics of a server or Ldev directly through the “Capacity -&gt; Server Cluster Report” page. New icons are available next to the server cluster name or the Ldev name(s), that directly navigate to the Performance Menu and trigger the creation of the respective graphic(s) Improvements to interactive performance graphics: all timeseries graphics which display a single plot (e.g. MP, CWPR, etc.) now exhibit a description of the y-axis, identical to the description found in the png version of the graphic Ldev Nicknames: Ldev performance graphics now include the Ldev nickname in the title ADR Views in Capacity (beta) Support for ADR in the IOportal has started. The first features - with more to come - are: Automatic Pool categorisation: The IOportal automatically detects the capacity savings type of pools. Possible categories are: FMC pool, ADR (Compression), ADR (Compression & Deduplication) or no capacity savings. The capacity savings type of a pool is always shown next to the pool name on all affected pages/views. Note: in order to activate this feature the IOportal requires additional output from the Raidcom command. This may require an update of the collector scripts - please contact support@peaq.ch for assistance. The “Capacity -&gt; Storage Array Report” page has a new visualisation for ADR-enabled pools. The capacity savings value is displayed, along with a computed logical view that corresponds to the capacity as seen by the consumers. Note: the ADR features are still work in progress and will improve over time Docker Version for On-Premise Installations Starting with this release our on-premise customers can enjoy the benefits of a containerised solution: effortless installation and updates, even in fully isolated environments without internet access.

From a total reimplementation of the engine - only perceivable by the user as a substantial gain in graphic generation speed - to the new and revolutionary Anomaly Detection System, almost no part of the IOportal remained untouched. While preserving all the strong features of the IOportal the users are familiar with and love for their intuitive use and unparalleled insight into Hitachi storage arrays dynamical behavior we added several new views and dashboards guiding the user from her/his logon to the IOportal to any anomaly detected by our smart, AI based Anomaly Radar revealing the root cause of performance degradations and resource constraints/bottlenecks within a few clicks. Whether you work from a laptop or workstation or any mobile device (tablet and/or mobile phone) the new appearance of the IOportal V8 adapts itself to your device and allows you to navigate and enjoy the graphs and reports with the same ease of use and the same level of presentation quality. IOportal v8.0 Release Notes UI/UX Improved Support for mobile Devices: Improve navigation and graph presentation for improved user experience. Performance Analysis Anomaly Radar : Leverage an AI based anomaly detection algorithm to highlight abnormal storage system behavior and guide the user automatically to the next step in the root cause identification process. Storage Array Dashboard : Provide KPI values for a user selectable date and the past 90 days. Also provide additional valuable information to accelerate root cause analysis. Server/Cluster Concept : The new concept allows to unambiguously distinguish between different servers/clusters and takes varying Lun configuration (over time) into account when creating performance graphs. Ldev Group Aggregation : Based on the new Server / Cluster concept the Ldev (Logical Device) data aggregation was completely redesigned to be more flexible. It handles servers / clusters, pools and Mainframe Control Units. Improved Graphic Performance : Depending on the time resolution (average interval) and the length of the time range the performance of the graph creation process was improved by a factor 2 – 5. 60 sec time resolution : 60 sec time resolution (average interval) was added for all performance graphs for the past 14 days data and a time range less than or equal to 24 hours. For longer time ranges the IOportal automatically switches to longer resolution. Storage Array Comparison Workload / Performance / Resource Utilisation : Provide direct comparison of customer’s storage arrays for workload, performance and resource utilisation based daily aggregated data for a user selectable date. Capacity View Historical Values for Ldevs and Ldev Groups: Server / Cluster Report: Miscellaneous Top10 WWN Performance Graph: Reduce number of WWN graphs by grouping IOPS, TPUT and Response time into a standard Top10 chart adding Worktime. Improved CWPR Performance Graph: Reduce number of CWPR graphs by incorporating all Cache blades into a single graph. The IOportal has continuously been improved over the past 10 years since its inception and has kept setting new levels of storage system capacity and performance analysis that helped customers leverage their Hitachi storage systems to achieve the highest possible business value. Share on: Werner Lippert With the background of a PhD in Physics and 30+ years of experience in data analysis, different kinds of Unix flavours and storage technologies Werner designed and implemented the first versions of the IOportal, which has proven to solve all kinds of storage related questions in countless situations over the past 10 years.

After the successful 3DC implementation in 2020, the much awaited for support for 3 Data Center (3DC) replications, in 2021 we exclusively focussed on specific customer requirements, which help facilitate each storage administrators life. peaq has proven over the years that the company is strong enough to compete with major players when it comes to developing storage management tools and yet light enough to sometimes outperform them. The first published version of SAM4H in 2016 already strictly followed concrete customer requirements and this paradigm has remained peaq’s approach to define and implement new features and functionalities. Now let’s have a look at what SAM4H V2 has to offer. The first thing you’ll notice when you start SAM4H V2 is the totally new user interface (UI/UX) layout. The new layout not only appears in a nicer outfit and groups corresponding features better together than the previous version, it also comes with new underlying libraries providing more flexibility for user interactions. As an example, a user may execute a full text search on the task list and filter by any object. As another example, the user can now trigger actions for an interactively selected number of objects directly out of the Cluster LUN report. The most important new features in SAM4H V2 can be grouped together in 4 categories as shown above. Besides them, there is a whole zoo of minor improvements, which cannot all be covered here.

      "text": "SAM4H Release v2.1 SAM4H IOportal Contact Support Blog peaq GmbH Analytics & automation Contact Info Neugutstrasse 12 Wallisellen 8304 Switzerland Learn More IOportal SAM4H Follow Us SAM4H SAM4H Release v2.1 23 Aug 2022 By Philip Kurmann Today we are proud to announce version 2.1 of the Smart Automation Manager For Hitachi, SAM4H. After introducing a new design in version 2.0, we further improved performance and polished the UI. Nevertheless, this release brings very useful new features like LUN editing, an extended full-text search and an enhanced dashboard. On top of that, the majority of the configuration options are now stored in the database, which enables changing parameters without the need to restart the application. The first published version of SAM4H in 2016 was already strictly designed along concrete customer requirements. This paradigm has remained peaq’s approach to define and implement new features and functionalities. Now let us have a look at what SAM4H V2.1 has to offer. The first thing you notice when you start SAM4H V2.1 is the new dashboard: in the first row you see all important capacity KPIs at a glance. The second diagram offers an interactive capacity overview bar chart over all arrays, while the following diagram shows the same capacity comparison in form of a treemap chart. Clicking on an array either on the bar chart or treemap chart leads you to the new array dashboard, which offers a drill-down into the capacity of the clusters of the selected storage array. The final chart on the dashboard page depicts a statistic of all tasks executed in SAM4H, grouped by type, state or user for a user-defined time-range. Besides the mentioned features, SAM4H v2.1 offers following improvements: SAM4H v2.1 Release Notes General improvements Extended full-text search: A global full-text search allows for searching and finding objects across the entire SAM4H landscape Config options in the database: The content of the famous config.yml-file is now stored almost entirely in the database, allowing config-changes without the need to restart the application. The whole file is loaded automatically during the first start after the migration. Multiple performance improvements for large installations: Various performance improvements in the array management and the reports make SAM4H ready for installations with several dozens of storage arrays. Real dark mode: SAM4H v2.1 offers a completely redesigned dark mode. Array Management Edit LUNs: Edit LUNs is finally here. This empowers SAM4H to change LUN-parameters of existing volumes. MP-Pinning: Volumes configured on the wrong MP can lead to cross-I/O which degrades the I/O-performance between the server and the array. On VSP5000 series, SAM4H automatically determines the optimal MPU based on the mapped ports and pins volumes to this MPU, thus optimising performance. Notes: Every DpvConfigTemplate can now be extended with specific notes and information for the storage operators. Notes can also be added to the login screen, e.g. a disclaimer. Reports New dashboard: More insights, thanks to the new and completely revamped dashboard. ALUA warnings in the Cluster LUN Report: The Cluster LUN Report was extended with warnings about misconfigured sites and host-groups, which could potentially lead to false ALUA-configuration. GUI All forms displayed in modals: Forms are displayed in modals. This preserves search results and makes the UI more streamlined. REST-API REST-API for hosts: The REST-API was extended by a host-API. Now it is possible, to configure / read hosts through REST-calls. Already being established as the state-of-the-art storage management tool for Hitachi storage, SAM4H V2.1 brings along a whole set of exciting and useful new features that help facilitate storage administrators’ life even more.

Although not as easy as stopping a domino, taking provisions for a complete datacenter outage is certainly worth the effort. As such, Hitachi IOportal is now available with a complete disaster recovery solution that guarantees our customers unfettered access to the IOportal service even in a disaster scenario. This includes access to the IOportal, the capability to create performance graphics for the past 30 days and complete access to the Dashboard, Cockpit and Capacity features. Furthermore, customers’ export files will still be received and processed by the IOportal. A solution is born When we set out to develop a disaster recovery solution, it quickly became clear that we first need to clearly define the business cases that should be protected. This exercise resulted in a detailed functionality scope that the solution must fulfil. This first specification helped to coarsely decide on the sizing and capabilities of the disaster recovery solution. Next, we set out to discuss non-functional requirements, especially around operating the system. Such a requirement was for instance the need to keep the code version on both production and disaster recovery systems in sync without manual intervention. Another area of intensive discussion was the need to limit day-to-day operational activities to the production system alone, instead of duplicating the workload and maintain two systems. As the discussions proceeded, a list of tasks formed with all various custom implementations that are required in order to achieve our goals. Finally, a crucial part of the design process was the careful E2E simulation of the various steps and phases that will play out during a disaster event: Detecting the disaster Deciding whether to switch to the disaster recovery solution or not Operations during disaster recovery Recovery of primary system Resuming regular operations Going through all theses steps again and again while considering all system aspects, i.e. networking, DNS etc., validated our design and further revealed all the bits and pieces that were missing in terms of functionality. Disaster Recovery Architecture At the end we devised following architecture: Offsite location for disaster recovery, in the same VPN as our data center Fully automatic setup of disaster recovery site via Ansible (infrastructure): this includes installing the OS, bootstrapping and installing dedicated software packages on three VMs per environment (total 6 VMs) Automatic application deployment (both front and backend) via Capistrano simultaneously on both sites (see our dedicated blog post on Capistrano Batch jobs for periodically copying over the production database and required csv files from production to disaster recovery, such that we achieve our desired Recovery Point Objective (RPO) Activation of disaster recovery solution via change of either nameservers or A-records. Users are automatically routed to the secondary site Automatic instantaneous duplication of export files between production and disaster recovery sites (both directions) Automatic heartbeat monitoring of production system from offsite location and alerting Is it worth it? Implementing the disaster recovery solution required significant effort. However, a great deal of it involved implementing automatisation which benefits the system per se, irrespective of the disaster recovery case. With every new environment that we set up and every new rollout we perform, we save time and get standardised and improved quality. This is for sure a worthy investment that keeps paying dividends with time. And finally, it was worth feeling the satisfaction that our customers can enjoy the IOportal cloud service no matter what!

The Hitachi IOportal offers several tools that enable storage administrators to quickly obtain the most important metrics, by means of the IOportal Dashboard, Cockpit and Capacity views. Nevertheless, it can still happen that important anomalies are overseen and ignored. In the worst case this can lead to incidents with business impact. Ideally, the IOportal should proactively alert the users of significant events and explicitly draw their attention to them. Well, there are good news! The newest release of Hitachi IOportal introduces alerting! The new alerting functionality informs the IOportal user of all significant events as soon as the user logs in, by displaying appropriately colored banners – one for each alert category. Clicking on the banner forwards the user to the respective detailed view. Furthermore, a new navigation menu, denoted by an exclamation mark, acts as the alert home page and provides further details on each alert. Finally, the user can subscribe to a daily email that summarises all alerts. Alert Categories Following alert categories are available in the first incarnation of the feature: Pool Capacity Alerts : a warning alert is triggered when the physical or logical pool capacity is above 75%. A risk alert is triggered when the pool utilisation is above 85%. HORCM File Delivery Alerts : warning or error alerts are triggered when certain HORCM files have not been delivered or updated during the last 24 hours or 3 days, respectively. Export File Delivery Alerts : warning or error alerts are triggered when the last 24 hours, respectively 72 hours, are not covered by export log files. Outlook The above alert categories lay the foundation for monitoring a storage array: they comprise pool capacity alerts, which may cause a standstill of operations if they a pool runs full, and file delivery alerts (export and horcm), since we can’t monitor anything if the monitoring log files are not available. Future releases will further build on this powerful feature and provide finer grained and more sophisticated alerts which will increase the value proposition of the IOportal even further!

It is designed from the ground up around the premise ‘Rules First’. This ensures that all storage tasks are executed in the same way and follow a standard, even when executed by different members in large teams. New in V1.7 3DC Support SAM4H is the best tool for easily managing GAD replications. In release v1.7 we bring this to the next level, by offering the same simplicity and automation to 3DC setups. Customers that operate their storage environment in a 3 DC setup – using a GAD pair and a third location with Hitachi Universal Replicator, can now simplify, automate and standardize their operations with SAM4H: Provision 3DC LUNs without expert knowledge Create/modify/inspect all 3DC objects via an easy to use graphical user interface No need to touch any HORCM-files REST API Improvements The improved REST API makes it possible to trigger SAM4H actions from outside the application, via REST. This way, it is possible to integrate SAM4H in various higher level automation workflows, like for instance with Hitachi Automator or Ansible . Following actions are supported: creating LUNs creating HostGroups polling TaskGroups peaq believes in open architectures and integration of IT systems for maximizing customer value. Along these lines, the REST API will be further enhanced and extended in future releases. Other new features Support for post-process capacity saving mode Configurable links on welcome page Improved PortGroup handling (multiple PortGroups per Port allowed) Improved consistency group handling Export and Import Templates as JSONs Display task progress bar Support for Sequences in LUN Labels Individual QD Log for each Storage Array Possibility to select the VSM while creating a HostGroup Clone HG Config Template Clone Cluster Queue Dispatcher Satellites Queue Dispatcher threaded mode 2 IPs for HORCM files Custom LUN-labels for each DpVolTemplate Various Fixes How to get SAM4H v1.7 The latest version of SAM4H as well as previous stable versions are available in the peaq Service Portal for existing customers.

It is designed from the ground up around the premise ‘Rules First’. This ensures that all storage tasks are executed in the same way and follow a standard even when executed by different members in large teams. New in V1.5 Recently we released V1.5 of SAM4H. The new version has some long awaited features like tenant capability and deletion of host groups. Thanks to the integration of Elasticsearch it is now possible to efficiently search across all executed tasks. Tenant capability This has been one of the most awaited features: It is now possible to create users which only have privileges for non destructive tasks on selected servers. This will let you create a self-service portal for adding and removing LUNs to some servers. Unix and DB administrators are now allowed to manage their own server storage by themselves. GAD Monitoring With the new GAD Monitoring feature, SAM4H periodically checks if GAD replications exist, which are not in pair. If any broken pairs are found, an email notification is generated. Full text search Over time, the timeline in the main view can get very long. We now integrated Elasticsearch into SAM4H, which enables fulltext search in the timeline and brings its value to the next level. Other new features Split Replications: Choose between splitting one single replication or the whole CTG Delete Hostgroups Delete and Unmap a LUN in one step Individual LUN-Labeling (Enter LUN-labels when creating LUNs) LUN-Report improvements: Configurable columns Sort Display copystatus Display consistency group Nicknames is displayed in the LUN selectors Audit Log-File ReadOnly-Flag for Clusters (Read Only Clusters are only selectable for reports and are hidden in the provisioning sections) Copy Template Check for correct characters when entering WWNs Bugfixes Multiple GUI improvements Request a demo or PoC Please contact us, if you’d like to learn more about SAM4H.

Capacity & Performance Monitoring You can only improve your storage system services if you measure and understand their capacity and performance Visual Root Cause Analysis IOportal unique analytical methods allow for fast, reliable and visual root cause identification Health Checks Identify and mitigate slow creeping performance degradations with the IOportal Health Checks With its intuitive navigation, comprehensive graphs and reports the cloud based IOportal is the ideal capacity and performance management tool for any small to large and very large sized customers. Thanks to its easy, fast implementation customers get immediate return on investment. Integrated visual root cause identification, inherent data aggregation specifically for storage system analysis, dedicated server graphs independant of their underlying operating system, and a smart, artificial intelligence based anomaly detection system in combination with the new dashboard that guides you from the automatic detection of an anomaly allow reduced size storage management teams to manage a large and very large number of storage systems with ease. Looking for root causes of an incident is usually a time-consuming and painful excercise, especially outside normal working hours and/or during weekends. A tool that automatically and reliably detects the cause of a performance degradation will make storage administrators, managers and customers life easier. The IOportal does exactly that. The IOportal complementary Health Check Service helps identify slow creeping performance degradations and capacity constraints that are otherwise difficult to detect on a day-to-day basis. With a fixed document structure the customer gets a standard Health Check report that is discussed face-to-face including findings, conclusions and corrective action with the goal to fix any issue before the storage consumers are faced with performance degradations. The Health Check reports cover long term evolution of system workload, resource utilisation, performance (that is response times) and threshold excess. For the critical resources, like ports, crossbar or the VSP5x00 interconnect, dedicated reports help identify hotspots and recommendations allow to balance resource utilisation in order to achieve maximum scalability of the storage system. Thus, the IOportal Health Check service ensures long time stability and optimum performance giving customers the peace of mind to focus on their day-to-day business tasks. IOportal Up and running within a few hours! 1 Install Install IOportal Agent. 2 Configure Configure agent, firewall and Cloud Service. 3 Log In Generate insights from day 1 Features Cloud Service Accessible from anywhere and any device Analytics Integrated analytics functions Scalable Manage very large number of storage systems from anywhere Easy to use Rapid deployment and fast learning curve Versatile Monitor Open and Mainframe systems Efficient Increase infrastructure efficiency and reduce operational risk Made for Hitachi Supports Hitachi block storage Proactive Proactive Health Checks are available as an add-on service Open REST API for integration with 3rd party systems Quotes \"One of our central storage systems with 500 connected servers was hit by severe performance degradations threatening all connected servers and business critical applications. After several months of failed attempts at identifying the root cause and mitigating the impact by a countless series of unsuccessful hardware, firmware and software component upgrades, leaving a long trail of blood, sweat and tears behind, the data was eventually uploaded to the IOportal cloud service and the root cause could be identified within 30 mins, the involved server/database was shut down and the nightmare stopped immediately.\" \"Thanks to the IOportal we could work out a storage landscape refresh of our 300+ storage systems within a weekend. With the level of aggregation and the concise and meaningful graphs the IOportal offers it was minimum effort to work out the requirements in terms of capacity and performance and plan new storage infrastructure accordingly.\" Screenshots View Larger Anomaly Radar IOportal Dashboard Upon entering the IOportal, find out easily whether one or more arrays experienced a performance anomaly duringt the previous day.

However, there is more than a fresh paint. The redesigned IOportal is fully responsive: you can even create and analyze complex performance graphics on your mobile device! Improvements have been made in other areas as well: New design , colors, fonts and icons, make the IOportal easier to work with, navigate and orientate. Fully responsive – works great on tablets and smartphones. Groups/locations : Customers can create groups of storage arrays by means of a group name (e.g. DC_North, SAP_Production etc). This makes it easier to consume the various IOportal views focusing on specific storage arrays, while all other arrays that are not part of the group are hidden. This functionality is especially useful for customers with many storage arrays. Performance Graphics : The thumbnails graphics in the Performance menu have descriptive titles that makes it easier to orientate. The dynamic graphics, that are displayed when clicking on thumbnails, exhibit the same detailed title like the png graphics, offering a multitude of useful information for better understanding and interpreting the graphic. New alerting design : the alerting functionality has been redesigned and tamed to be less obtrusive. The number of current alerts is displayed with a counter on the alert home page icon. When clicked, the user obtains a brief summary. Further details are available in the alert home page. Whats next The redesigned IOportal forms the basis for implementing exciting new features. Radical changes to the whole experience are in the works and we can’t wait to share them with you. Stay tuned!

Some of them are installed on premise on a customer server. Although such applications are not publicly accessible, you want to secure their connections by SSL though. The typical recommendation for deploying Rails-Apps says, you should set up NGINX or Apache to serve the assets and use those web servers as reverse proxies for routing all dynamic requests to the Rails application-server (like Unicorn or Puma). But typically such private applications do not have heavy load and it would be overkill to deploy them with this approach. It would be handy to have an application server, which handles SSL directly. The good answer: It is possible with Puma! Configure your Rails-App to use Puma First you need to configure Puma to be your application server. There’s a good chance, that you can skip this step as Puma is the default application server since Rails 5. But for all which are still using Rails 4, add the following line to your Gemfile: gem 'puma' Create your SSL certificates Once Puma is your default application server, it is time to create the SSL certificates. We are using openssl for this. There are 5 steps, you need to execute: Step 1: Generate your private key openssl genrsa -des3 -passout pass:x -out server.pass.key 2048 Step 2: Remove passphrase from key openssl rsa -passin pass:x -in server.pass.key -out server.key Step 3: Generate a CSR (Certificate Signing Request) openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr Step 4: Generating a Self-Signed Certificate openssl x509 -req -sha256 -days 365 -in server.csr -signkey server.key -out server.crt Step 5: Copy the CSR- and KEY-Files to your config directory cp server.crt server.key /path_to_your/rails_app/config Test: Start your Rails-App with SSL Once Puma is your application server, simply start the server with the following options, and you have SSL connection to your Rails App: puma -b 'ssl://127.0.0.1:3000?key=/path_to_your/rails_app/config/server.key&cert=/path_to_your/rails_app/config/server.crt' Configure Puma If the test is successful, Puma could be configured with a config file called config/puma.rb. The advantage of doing it this way is, that you don’t need to remember all the SSL-options for starting your server. Here is a working puma.rb configured for SSL: # Config Parameters app_root = ENV [ 'APP_ROOT' ] || '.' rails_env = ENV [ 'RAILS_ENV' ] || 'production' ip_addr = ENV [ 'IP_ADDR' ] || 'localhost' port = ENV [ 'PORT' ] || 3000 ssl_key = ENV [ 'SSL_KEY' ] ssl_cert = ENV [ 'SSL_CERT' ] # Set Puma parameters preload_app! rackup DefaultRackup environment rails_env pidfile \" #{ app_root } /tmp/pids/puma.pid\" state_path \" #{ app_root } /tmp/pids/puma.state\" threads 0 , 16 workers 2 stdout_redirect \" #{ app_root } /log/puma.log\" , \" #{ app_root } /log/puma.err\" , true if rails_env . downcase == 'production' # HTTP or HTTPS if ssl_key . present? && ssl_cert . present? bind \"ssl:// #{ ip_addr } : #{ port } ?key= #{ ssl_key } &cert= #{ ssl_cert } \" else bind \"tcp:// #{ ip_addr } : #{ port } \" end Share on: Philip Kurmann Developing software to manage storage infrastructure for business critical customer environments, that is easy to use and yet robust and error free, requires excellent knowledge in both software development and storage infrastructure. Philip possesses both in a unique way combined with the strive to deliver best-of-breed solutions that are fun to use.

IOportal offers a detailed view of each DP-pool, along with a graphics that illustrates the evolution of the pool during the past year as well as a prediction for the next six months. But what about a condensed pool status view over all pools across all storage arrays, where all important information is available at a glance? New DP-pool bubble chart in IOportal Cockpit Look no further: the new DP-pool bubble chart in IOportal Cockpit brings together the most important DP-pool information in one single chart! Each bubble represents one DP-pool whereas the color of the bubble indicates the storage array. The horizontal position of a bubble represents the allocated pool size. The vertical position represents the percentage of used capacity. Bubbles that are close to the 100% line are almost full. Is this a problem? Well, it depends. If the pool size is still growing, then maybe. If the pool size is growing fast, then certainly. We capture these dynamics in the size of the bubbles: big bubbles indicate pools that are growing „fast“. How fast is fast? Actually it does not matter. What matters is how soon we expect the pool to run full. Hence, very big bubbles indicate pools that will run full within 3 months. You want to do something about those. The smaller the bubble size, the longer it takes until the pool runs full. So in fact it does not matter if a pool is close to 100% full. There may be a new pool lurking with lots of free space, that nevertheless grows rapidly and requires close monitoring. The bubble size is all you need to look at. So there you are. One chart is all it takes to be the master of your DP-pools.
